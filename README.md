3. Implement music library:
   - Create a `Library` component to display the user's saved songs, playlists, or albums.
   - Allow users to add songs to their library and create playlists.
   - Store the user's library data in the application state.

### Release 2: Search and Discover

1. Implement search functionality:
   - Create a `SearchBar` component that allows users to search for songs, albums, or artists.
   - Display search results based on user input.
   - Enable users to play songs directly from the search results.

2. Implement artist and album pages:
   - Create separate `ArtistPage` and `AlbumPage` components for displaying artist details and album information.
   - Show related songs, albums, or artists on each respective page.

3. Implement music recommendations:

   - Display recommended songs or playlists on the `Home` page or in a separate recommendations section.

### Release 3: User Interaction and Sharing

1. User interactions:
   - Allow users to like or favorite songs, albums, or playlists.
   - Create a `LikedSongs` component to display a user's liked or favorited songs.
   - Implement a feature to add or remove songs from the liked songs list.

Guidelines:
- Use React functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for building the user interface and managing state.
- Utilize React Router for navigation between different views, such as the `Home` page, search results, and artist/album pages.
- Store music data, user library, and preferences in a state management tool like Redux or the React Context API.
- Consider using a UI library like Material-UI, Ant Design, or React Bootstrap for enhanced visual components.
- You can use Spotify Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to fetch sample music data and integrate it into your Music Streaming Service app.
- Use Axios or Fetch API to interact with a mock API or server for data fetching and manipulation.
- Provide clear instructions on how to run the application and any necessary setup steps in the documentation.
